# Welcome

This is the official documentation page for the emulation project of the
mechanical calculator Brunsviga 13 RK from the 1950s. The goal of this page is
to provide explanatory resource about the usage and behavior of the web based
simulation.

## Demonstration

The most recent release of the simulation is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://brunsviga13rk.github.io/emulator).

## Requirements

The simulation requires a relatively recent browser version that is compliant
to the [ES2020](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/) specification and
supports WebGL 2.0. Most up-to-date browsers based on Firefox or Chromium
should work just fine.
